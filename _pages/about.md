I am a Machine Learning and Medical Imaging Researcher pursuing my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Mila and McGill University, supervised by Prof. Tal Arbel. My research focuses on generative AI and diffusion models, particularly their applications in medical imaging. I am interested in how generative models can improve fairness, robustness, and interpretability in AI systems.

Previously, I worked at ETH ZÃ¼rich and EPFL, where I contributed to projects in 3D reconstruction and human motion prediction. My experience spans deep learning, representation learning, and probabilistic modeling, with a strong background in computer vision and generative models. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, where I developed an interest in machine learning and computer vision.
